Common library for all simulation handlers.
This library provides shared functionality and utilities that can be used across different simulation handlers to ensure consistency and reduce code duplication. It includes common data structures, helper functions, and base classes that can be extended by specific simulation handlers.
All handler base classes, vendor base classes, and common utilities should be placed in this library.
